Cleans data usually associated with facilities or column names. Specifically
removes special characters (except spaces, dashes, and slashes), capitalizes COVID, standardizes
COVID-19 references, removes new line indicators and excess white space,
and changes "state-wide" to "statewide" (case-insensitive).
Optionally capitalizes output.
